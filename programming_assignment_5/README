-------To be noticed-----------
in this program, I used array, I don't remember which line, but the line is like "bytes[curr_pos] = currChar"
In here, just simply change it to *(bytes + curr_pos) = currChar, can solve the problem using array
By the way, it is the same thing becaues it doesn't matter if using array or not, teacher told us to use string literal, but string literal literally is a array
Then I found out we were suppose to use something like strcat()................. hehe.....you never know
